# My-First-Experience-with-Datascience

This is my first data science project from Kaggle(<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sciplic/my-first-experience-with-datascience">to the project</a>). It is based on a flight delay prediction. The data comes from Kaggle where the U.S. Department of Transportation uploaded and explained the files.

You can find my Kaggle profile <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sciplic">here (click!)</a> as well.

## Context (from Kaggle)
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

## Acknowledgements
The flight delay and cancellation data was collected and published by the DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
